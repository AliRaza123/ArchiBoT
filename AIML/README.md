ArchiBoT (AIML brain)
====================

ArchiBoT's AI is based on open-sourced **[Rosie](https://github.com/pandorabots/rosie)** AIML files, with extra modifications.

Every user is welcomed to contribute to ArchiBoT's AI, in order to do so:
1. Create **[new file](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiBoT/new/master/AIML/lib/aiml)**
2. Name it using your selected unique identifier, prefix with ```_``` and use ```.aiml``` extension, such as ```_bob.aiml```
3. Put default AIML content:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<aiml>
</aiml>
```

4. Fill the body of ```<aiml>``` however you want.

ArchiBoT's AI includes support for AIML 1.1 and AIML 2.0 language. For new contributions, I strongly encourage to use 2.0 syntax, which is fully documented **[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wNT25hJRyupcG51aO89UcQEiG-HkXRXusukADpFnDs4/pub)**. You can also find extra documentation, including the one for AIML 1.1 **[here](http://www.alicebot.org/documentation/)**.

However, AIML is really easy, and you can base your work on already available **[examples](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiBoT/tree/master/AIML/lib/aiml)**. Simply select the one you like for an overview how AIML looks like.

5. When done, commit your changes and wait for approval :+1:
